            <p>
                I am an Entertainment Technologies major set to graduate next fall.
                I currently serve as the student president Of The Nationl Society Of
                Leadership and Success. In addition to serving as Vice President of Phi Theta Kappa 
                 Honor Society and being a member of the LCTS Leadership Development Academy.
                 I recently had enough courage to start my own entertainment company so this class is helping me learn 
                 to control every aspect of what I put on the internet which I feel is a big deal.
                 I'm also a mother of five.
